# Vanilla Node.js web application
This is a secure, barebones, vanilla Node.js web application.
It does not use ***any*** third-party packages.

The web application consists of a few different pages and files.
It sets some security related headers, offers a simple API, login page, displaying CSS, fonts and images, error handling and more.
It's very basic, to say the least, but it's secure and functions well.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Node.js on its own can be used to serve content on the web.
If you're only going to build a basic web application, then using no third-party packages might be a way to do it!
It's lightweight, very quick page loading times, future-proof and easy to maintain.

## Running the server
