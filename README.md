# Vanilla Node.js web application
This is a secure, barebones, vanilla Node.js web application.
It does not use any third-party packages.

The web application consists of a few different pages and files.
It's very basic, to say the least, but it's secure and functions well.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Node.js on its own can be used to serve content on the web.

## Running the server
```
node main.mjs
```
